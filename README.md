# About Me.
My name is **Parker Banks** and I am a student at _Wake Tech Community College_. I am currently studying for a CS degree, though I am unsure of the field that I would like to go into. In this ReadMe file, you will learn a little bit about me. I am interested in _the interworkings of the mind and the way the mind makes connections_. I originally went to school at _Appalachian State_ for a **BFA in Studio Art**, and I would make sculptures that were a sort of amalgamation of connections in my mind.

## Interests
In my free time I like to read, make art and music, play with my wonderful dogs, shop at thrift stores, horde various nothings, and play video games. I am fond of almost any genre of both music and video game. The media that I find myself drawn to are ones that try to push the boundaries of how we see and interact with art. There are a few hobbies that I enjoy, and I am looking to expand on the types of hobbies I like as to minimize my time spent playing video games. Some of those hobbies include _building custom mechanical keyboards_, _kit-bashing anything I can find_, and _practicing muscial instruments_.

## Websites I Recommend
    -[Monkeytype Typing Test](www.monkeytype.com) - I enjoy trying to improve my typing speed, it is both fun and helpful for efficiency in the digital age.
    -[Typelit](www.typelit.io) - Like Monkeytype, but you are typing out classic literature instead of randomly generated word jumbles.
    -[Block Colors](www.blockcolors.app) - I am a big fan of building in Minecraft, and this allows me to pick colors from a color wheel and helps me find blocks that work in that color range.
    -[Block Palettes](www.blockpalettes.com) - Yet another site for Minecraft building resources, this time for helping to find color schemes to work with.
